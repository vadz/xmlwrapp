# future git-blame invocations, run the following command:
#
#   git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# When adding entries to this file, please keep them in reverse chronological
# order (the newest ones are added at the top).

#
#   $ git show -s --format='# %s, %cs%n%H%n'
#
# incantation to directly create an entry in the format used here.
